This is a indevelopment project so no fancy readme yet, sorry

but in resume the project is waaaay early in development, as this is a hobby project i dont intend on doing it meant to be used in production, BUT maybe this can change in the future since i plan on doing a plugin system for it

for now sharpcraft only displays a MoTD, a simple config file, where you can change the server's ip and stuff like the motd, and part of the login process

i plan on at least doing a simple generator so we can have a world to walk on :p

here is a silly screenshot of the server "working"
